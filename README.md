RFMarkdownTextView
==================

This is a UITextView that is supposed to replicate the comment toolbar in iOctocat (http://ioctocat.com) with auto-insert markdown functionality.

##Installation

### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like RFMarkdownTextView in your projects.

#### Podfile

```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod "RFMarkdownTextView", "~> 1.0"
```

### Installation without CocoaPods

Just drag the RFMarkdownTextView folder into your project and import it.

```
#import 'RFMarkdownTextView.h'
```

## Use

RFMarkdownTextView is like any other UITextView - just set it up with `initWithFrame:` and you're good to go.

Hope you enjoy it!
